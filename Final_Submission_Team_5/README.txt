The goal of this project is to create a Predictive Model regarding the 'mpg' value of mpg.data.csv which is provided by Airbnb on a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) "Public Domain Dedication" license, so it is free to use in this project.

This project contains 5 files:

1. A power BI file for data visualization before any data preprocessing(D01_Team5_Visualization_Before_Preprocessing.pbix)
2. A jupyter notebook for Exploratory Data Analysis(D02_Team5_EDA.ipynb)
3. A jupyter notebook for Data Preprocessing(D03_Team5_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb)
4. A power BI file for data visualization after data preprocessing(D04_Team5_Data_Visualization.pbix)
5. A jupyter notebook with the predictive model(D05_Team5_Machine_Learning.ipynb)

The 3rd file(D03_Team5_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb) exports preprocessed data to mpg.preprocessed.xslx file.
The 5th file(D05_Team5_Machine_Learning.ipynb) imports mpg.preprocessed.xslx file.

Import required libraries

1.jupyter
2.numpy
3.pandas
4.matplotlib
5.seaborn
6.scikit-learn

For 'mpg' prediction run with the following order:
